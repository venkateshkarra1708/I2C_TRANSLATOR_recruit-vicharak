I2C Translator - Brief Documentation
1. Architecture Overview
- The design works as an I²C address‑translator bridge.
- It listens to the master SCL/SDA, captures the address byte, and compares it with a configured address.
- If matched, it enables a bridge so master signals pass to the target device.
- If not matched, it stays idle.
- All signals follow open‑drain behavior.
2. FSM / Logic Explanation
IDLE
- Waits for START.
- Resets registers and counters.

ADDR
- Captures address bits on rising SCL.

DETE
- Compares received address with configured one.
- If match → ACK + bridge enable.
- If R/W=1 → R_BRIDGE, else → W_BRIDGE.

PASS
- Ignores bus until STOP or new START.

R_BRIDGE / W_BRIDGE
- Active bridging.
- On STOP → return to IDLE.
3. Address Translation Implementation
- Incoming address loads into add_reg.
- r_add (7 bits) compared with configured addr.
- If equal → translator ACKs and bridges.
- R/W bit decides direction path.
4. Design Challenges Faced
- Correct START/STOP detection.
- Capturing data only on rising SCL.
- Maintaining open‑drain behavior.
- Avoiding glitches by keeping everything synchronous.
- Clean bridge enable/disable logic.
